The inflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U, for all items) before seasonal adjustment.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if the index increased by more than 6.8% from January 2021 to January 2022 and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS January 2022 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled for release on February 10 2022, 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\nNote, that this market refers to the all items index increase for the 12 month period, before seasonal adjustment.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote, that the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 5.8%, 6.9%, etc).
