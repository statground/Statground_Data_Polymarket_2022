Having a live token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet, actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native or related to the application, protocol, technology, ecosystem, or parent company, and is substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. Empirically speaking, having a live token will be considered fulfilled if official project channels announce the introduction of the token and it is live on mainnet, and swappable and acquirable (i.e. via Uniswap). In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform. In the case that the token comes in the form of a DAO or DAO-like organizational structure that has governing or controlling power over the underlying tech or protocol, or is otherwise officially related to the project, instead of a traditional fee paying-related token, that will still qualify as launching a token. If zkSync or Matter Labs have a live token by May 1st, 2022, 12:00 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". If the resolution date is reached and the market resolution criteria has not been met, the market will resolve to \"No\".","endDate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-05-01","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"Crypto","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:44:46.014Z","commentCount":0,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:44:46.014Z","creationDate":"2022-01-11T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market group on whether several “Layer 2” projects will launch a token by May 1st, 2022.","enableNegRisk":false,"endDate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-this-layer-2-project-launch-a-token-by-may-1st-2022-619672a3-4258-4a47-87ac-89efbe4b5b35.png","id":"5850","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-this-layer-2-project-launch-a-token-by-may-1st-2022-619672a3-4258-4a47-87ac-89efbe4b5b35.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:44:46.007+00","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"will-this-layer2-project-launch-a-token-by-may1-2022","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-01-12T00:00:00Z","ticker":"will-this-layer2-project-launch-a-token-by-may1-2022","title":"Will this Layer 2 project launch a token by May 1st, 2022?","updatedAt":"2024-04-25T19:28:14.242611Z","volume":59438.49,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}],"featured":false,"fee":"18000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"1","groupItemTitle":"zkSync by Matter Labs","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-zksync-have-a-token-by-may-1st-2022-304445c8-541e-4bbb-a92d-662ec29293ff.png","id":"240566","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-zksync-have-a-token-by-may-1st-2022-304445c8-541e-4bbb-a92d-662ec29293ff.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"67.994169","liquidityNum":67.99,"mailchimpTag":"3932376","manualActivation":false,"marketGroup":55,"marketMakerAddress":"0xff6BE55aE19ba515dfF69897ce4624438c100C6a","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.000001167647334180602361249707903618326\", \"0.9999988323526658193976387502920964\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will zkSync have a token by May 1st, 2022?","questionID":"0x30916f4a294a882a31d86d03510a004cb6a7bf7e548ce6187aa6ea8151e9e131","ready":false,"readyForCron":true,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://info.uniswap.org/","resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"will-zksync-have-a-token-by-may-1st-2022","spread":1,"startDate":"2022-01-12T21:18:20.275Z","startDateIso":"2022-01-12","submitted_by":"0xd6dD8E5145ab3e344a6Cf9624bC0820d1aa8Dc1f","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1651330994072","twitterCardLastValidated":"1648782015.2193956","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-zksync-have-a-token-by-may-1st-2022.png?1651330994072","umaEndDate":"May 8, 2022","umaEndDateIso":"2022-05-08","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2024-04-22T23:15:52.957487Z","updatedBy":91,"volume":"5835.347271","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":5835.35,"wideFormat":false}
