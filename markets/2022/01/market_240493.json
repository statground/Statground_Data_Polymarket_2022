If the total supply is undefined, the circulating supply/non-diluted market cap will be used instead to resolve this market. \n\nIf the CoinGecko website is unavailable at the time of this check, or relevant data is unavailable on CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap will be used instead. If both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap are down, or relevant data is unavailable, then another credible source will be chosen.
