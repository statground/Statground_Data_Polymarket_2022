Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's approval rating poll aggregator,\nhttps://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/, specifically the approval rating indicated by the green trend line for the resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution data will be checked on January 27, 2022 according to data published for January 26.\n\nIf for any reason the resolution source is unavailable, the resolution source will be checked every 24 hours until the rating for the resolution date is available. If the rating is still not available on the resolution source a week later or Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the most recent available approval rating.\nPlease note, that the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.","endDate":"2022-01-26T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-01-26","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"US-current-affairs","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:43:17.586Z","commentCount":0,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:43:17.586Z","creationDate":"2022-01-11T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market group on Joe Biden’s job approval rating by FiveThirtyEight, for the day of January 26 2022.\n","enableNegRisk":false,"featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-joe-bidens-fivethirtyeight-approval-rating-be-on-january-26-2022-d377fea8-f7c9-438b-a369-76c1d38d7357.png","id":"5687","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-joe-bidens-fivethirtyeight-approval-rating-be-on-january-26-2022-d377fea8-f7c9-438b-a369-76c1d38d7357.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:43:17.583+00","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"what-will-joe-bidens-538-approval-rating-be-on-january-26-2022","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-01-12T00:00:00Z","ticker":"what-will-joe-bidens-538-approval-rating-be-on-january-26-2022","title":"What will Joe Biden's FiveThirtyEight approval rating be on January 26, 2022?","updatedAt":"2024-04-23T22:50:12.34531Z","volume":13583.76,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}],"featured":false,"fee":"18000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"1","groupItemTitle":"42.4% - 42.6%","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-joe-bidens-fivethirtyeight-approval-rating-be-between-424-and-426-on-january-26-1035c097-3bc6-4b8c-aa2a-abd6a8188596.png","id":"240393","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-joe-bidens-fivethirtyeight-approval-rating-be-between-424-and-426-on-january-26-1035c097-3bc6-4b8c-aa2a-abd6a8188596.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"0.000072","liquidityNum":0,"mailchimpTag":"3931356","manualActivation":false,"marketGroup":18,"marketMakerAddress":"0x34aB4ac9BdA44fb780D5341A3916FD20A5F29c10","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.0000006000305366915359663249952333912156\", \"0.9999993999694633084640336750047666\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Joe Biden's FiveThirtyEight approval rating be between 42.4% and 42.6% on January 26?","questionID":"0xca4ae5968efb96028d2e8641401165210ddfc7d6e34ce2ebf09387a0e0f1259f","ready":false,"readyForCron":true,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/","resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"will-joe-bidens-fivethirtyeight-approval-rating-be-between-42pt4-and-42pt6-on-january-26","spread":1,"startDate":"2022-01-12T20:59:07.505Z","startDateIso":"2022-01-12","submitted_by":"0x4b24b1b119fd23aD723A2C2286047CC453DF4AA1","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1643479905430","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-joe-bidens-fivethirtyeight-approval-rating-be-between-42pt4-and-42pt6-on-january-26.png?1643479905430","umaEndDate":"February 2, 2022","umaEndDateIso":"2022-02-02","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2024-04-23T00:39:02.225695Z","updatedBy":91,"volume":"943.59732","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":943.6,"wideFormat":false}
