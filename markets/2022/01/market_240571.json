The lower bound for this market is $0.80, and the upper bound is $3.20. \n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the coin’s listed price on its official CoinGecko page https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon. This market will resolve according to the “C” (aka closing price) listed for the candle titled “Tue 01 March 2022, 12:00:00”, with the “Price” tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on the resolution day. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the “C:” when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.)  \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the relevant cryptocurrency’s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value’s position within the upper and lower bound, if the final value is between these bounds. But if the final outcome value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.","endDate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-03-01","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"Crypto","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:43:25.267Z","commentCount":0,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:43:25.267Z","creationDate":"2022-08-25T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a group market on what the price of various Layer 1 cryptocurrencies will be on March 1st, 2022.","enableNegRisk":false,"endDate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-the-price-of-this-layer-1-cryptocurrency-be-on-march-1st-2022-scalars-46ada369-e90e-4e86-91c4-3d7e5c390a73.png","id":"5702","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-the-price-of-this-layer-1-cryptocurrency-be-on-march-1st-2022-scalars-46ada369-e90e-4e86-91c4-3d7e5c390a73.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:43:25.261+00","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"what-will-the-price-of-this-layer1-crypto-be-on-march-1-2022","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-01-12T00:00:00Z","ticker":"what-will-the-price-of-this-layer1-crypto-be-on-march-1-2022","title":"What will the price of this Layer 1 cryptocurrency be on March 1st, 2022?
