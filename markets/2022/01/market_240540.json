Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet, actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform. \n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token’s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition. \n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by March 31st, 2022, 12:00 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to “No”.","endDate":"2022-03-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-03-31","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"Crypto","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:44:54.071Z","commentCount":0,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:44:54.071Z","creationDate":"2022-01-11T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market group on if a variety of different crypto projects will launch and airdrop a native token by March 31st, 2022.","enableNegRisk":false,"featured":false,"icon":"","id":"5861","image":"","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:44:54.067+00","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"will-this-crypto-project-airdrop-a-native-token-by-march-31-2022","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-01-12T00:00:00Z","ticker":"will-this-crypto-project-airdrop-a-native-token-by-march-31-2022","title":"Will this crypto project airdrop a native token by March 31st, 2022?","updatedAt":"2024-04-26T03:31:46.360074Z","volume":695964.87,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}],"featured":false,"fee":"18000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"13","groupItemTitle":"Fractional","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-fractional-airdrop-a-native-token-by-march-31st-2022-69c86cf7-ef3b-491b-b0cb-e10aa8e4e4d3.png","id":"240540","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-fractional-airdrop-a-native-token-by-march-31st-2022-69c86cf7-ef3b-491b-b0cb-e10aa8e4e4d3.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"25.000009","liquidityNum":25,"mailchimpTag":"3932272","manualActivation":false,"marketGroup":54,"marketMakerAddress":"0xC4c992831fD9f764615F410833545cF8B6054637","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.0000009241346057150611376589129849584964\", \"0.999999075865394284938862341087015\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Fractional airdrop a native token by March 31st, 2022?","questionID":"0x76eeeb6e491fbe47e1e5e530165fad37f2c6a0d81d0bb37c51b8abcc7118abcb","ready":false,"readyForCron":true,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://info.uniswap.org/","resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"will-fractional-airdrop-a-native-token-by-march-31st-2022","spread":1,"startDate":"2022-01-12T21:14:46.223Z","startDateIso":"2022-01-12","submitted_by":"0xd6dD8E5145ab3e344a6Cf9624bC0820d1aa8Dc1f","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1648862489644","twitterCardLastValidated":"1648783307.8405607","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-fractional-airdrop-a-native-token-by-march-31st-2022.png?1648862489644","umaEndDate":"April 7, 2022","umaEndDateIso":"2022-04-07","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2024-04-23T00:08:19.205998Z","updatedBy":15,"volume":"3423.388739","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":3423.39,"wideFormat":false}
