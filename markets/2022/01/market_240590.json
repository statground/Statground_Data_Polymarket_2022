If the first round of elections is held in 2022, but the runoff occurs after 2022 - it still will be considered for this market.\n—-\nThe President and Vice President of Brazil are elected as a joint ticket using the two-round system. The first round of elections is scheduled to take place on 2 October 2022.\nThe candidate who receives more than 50% of the total valid votes in the first round is elected. If the 50% threshold is not met by any candidate, the two candidates who receive the most votes in the first round participate in a second round of voting, scheduled for 30 October 2022, and the candidate who receives the most votes in the second round is elected.\nThis market will resolve based on credible media sources reports and official info from The Superior Electoral Court of Brazil https://www.tse.jus.br/, as soon as the winner of the elections is decided. Please note, in certain circumstances the resolution of this market might be delayed in order to wait for further official, judicial or other relevant announcements, reports or decisions to resolve possible ambiguities or uncertainties.","endDate":"2022-10-30T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-10-30","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"Global Politics","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-11-01T04:56:55Z","commentCount":0,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:44:10.091Z","creationDate":"2022-01-12T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a group market on the winner of 2022 Presidential Elections in Brazil.","enableNegRisk":false,"endDate":"2022-10-30T00:00:00Z","featured":true,"featuredImage":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdd016ddd81b5d5366a4a621d5284ab3bc8d877c/0_0_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ccf5ccf098cfef3a29899cee80641f93","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/who-will-win-the-2022-brazilian-presidential-election-77452341-70ee-47ce-99b0-a72f83b979e4.png","id":"5796","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/who-will-win-the-2022-brazilian-presidential-election-77452341-70ee-47ce-99b0-a72f83b979e4.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:44:10.087+00","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"who-will-win-the-2022-brazilian-presidential-election","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-01-12T00:00:00Z","ticker":"who-will-win-the-2022-brazilian-presidential-election","title":"Who will win the 2022 Brazilian presidential election?","updatedAt":"2024-04-25T21:00:23.179238Z","updatedBy":"15","volume":333552.99,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}],"featured":false,"fee":"18000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"3","groupItemTitle":"João Doria","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-joão-doria-win-2022-presidential-elections-in-brazil-d79779a2-efa5-4c2f-a4b1-333c326de83b.png","id":"240590","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-joão-doria-win-2022-presidential-elections-in-brazil-d79779a2-efa5-4c2f-a4b1-333c326de83b.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"100.073303","liquidityNum":100.07,"mailchimpTag":"3932696","manualActivation":false,"marketGroup":59,"marketMakerAddress":"0x05f7F7040207Ef5C8dC33845D5D7b4FfFB720945","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.000002925104855942636266085766301253412\", \"0.9999970748951440573637339142336987\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will João Doria win 2022 Presidential Elections in Brazil?","questionID":"0x0b61899907a1698050de639a649d6d57e210fe2e8adec5b024431c2b790cf3b8","ready":false,"readyForCron":true,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://www.tse.jus.br/","resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"will-joo-doria-win-2022-presidential-elections-in-brazil","spread":1,"startDate":"2022-01-12T21:12:30.695Z","startDateIso":"2022-01-12","submitted_by":"0x4b24b1b119fd23aD723A2C2286047CC453DF4AA1","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1661168652364","twitterCardLastValidated":"1659020134.5206418","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-joo-doria-win-2022-presidential-elections-in-brazil.png?1661168652363","umaEndDate":"January 30, 2023","umaEndDateIso":"2023-01-30","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2024-04-24T23:39:27.761447Z","updatedBy":15,"volume":"2683.354291","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":2683.35,"wideFormat":false}
