Then, the rating will be taken from the chart below the Polling Data table. If the resolution data is still not available on the resolution source a week later or Joe Biden is not the President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the most recent available approval rating.\n\nPlease note, that the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.\nChanges in the methodology by which RCP calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.","endDate":"2022-01-22T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-01-22","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"US-current-affairs","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:42:46.225Z","commentCount":0,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:42:46.225Z","creationDate":"2022-01-11T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a group market on President Biden's average RealClearPolitics job approval rating for the resolution date, January 21 2022.","enableNegRisk":false,"featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-be-joe-bidens-rcp-job-approval-rating-on-january-21-3499ab7f-334e-4ee0-a532-c22d79cb78bd.png","id":"5625","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-be-joe-bidens-rcp-job-approval-rating-on-january-21-3499ab7f-334e-4ee0-a532-c22d79cb78bd.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:42:46.219+00","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president-biden-job-approval-7320.html","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"what-will-joe-bidens-rcp-job-approval-rating-be-on-january-21-2022","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-01-12T00:00:00Z","ticker":"what-will-joe-bidens-rcp-job-approval-rating-be-on-january-21-2022","title":"What will be Joe Biden's RCP job approval rating on January 21?","updatedAt":"2024-04-25T18:49:39.553277Z","volume":8554.54,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}],"featured":false,"fee":"18000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"2","groupItemTitle":"41.6%-41.8%","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-joe-bidens-rcp-job-approval-rating-on-january-21-be-between-416-and-418-406f75b6-750e-4135-a34b-c8a806a467fe.png","id":"240418","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-joe-bidens-rcp-job-approval-rating-on-january-21-be-between-416-and-418-406f75b6-750e-4135-a34b-c8a806a467fe.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"50.000006","liquidityNum":50,"mailchimpTag":"3931564","manualActivation":false,"marketGroup":24,"marketMakerAddress":"0xc46C5284c1a8092bC4284a7428B89142eE804eCd","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.0000002804972007726556593140654934186019\", \"0.9999997195027992273443406859345066\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Joe Biden's RCP job approval rating on January 21 be between 41.6% and 41.8%?","questionID":"0xbcf1627ee571bd148f71c94becf028cb0131433fd7c370df3483cbb0b92dee61","ready":false,"readyForCron":true,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president-biden-job-approval-7320.html","resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"will-joe-bidens-rcp-job-approval-rating-on-january-21-be-between-41pt6-and-41pt8","spread":1,"startDate":"2022-01-12T20:45:44.667Z","startDateIso":"2022-01-12","submitted_by":"0x4b24b1b119fd23aD723A2C2286047CC453DF4AA1","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1643070695077","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-joe-bidens-rcp-job-approval-rating-on-january-21-be-between-41pt6-and-41pt8.png?1643070695077","umaEndDate":"January 29, 2022","umaEndDateIso":"2022-01-29","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2024-04-24T23:46:58.455422Z","updatedBy":17,"volume":"3887.412484","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":3887.41,"wideFormat":false}
