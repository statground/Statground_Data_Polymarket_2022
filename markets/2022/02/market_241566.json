The top two finishers qualify for the Candidates Tournament 2022, which is the final qualification stage for the World Chess Championship 2023.\n\nIn the first stage of the FIDE Grand Prix, the players are divided into four pools of four, and the players in each pool play a double round-robin mini-tournament. The four winners of the pools progress to the second stage.\n\nIf there are players tied for first in the pool, the tied players play tie-breaks.\nTwo-way or three-way tie-breaks take the following format:\n•    Players play two rapid chess games at 15 minutes plus 10 seconds per move. In the case of a three-way tie, a single round-robin is played.\n•    If players are still tied, they play two blitz chess games at 3 minutes plus 2 seconds per move. In the case of a three-way tie, a single round-robin is played.\n•    If players are still tied, a single Armageddon chess game is played to decide the winner, in which black is declared the winner if the game is drawn. The time limit is 5 minutes for white, 4 minutes for black, and a 2 second per move increment from move 61. In the case of a three-way tie, lots are drawn to determine the players, and the loser of the lot shares second place with the loser of the Armageddon game.\n\nIn the case of a four-way tie, the players are divided into pairs and each pair plays a two-player tie-break by the above method. The two tie-break winners then play a tie-break by the above method, while the losers share third and fourth place in the pool.","enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2022-03-14T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-03-14","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"Chess","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:44:16.404Z","commentCount":0,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:44:16.404Z","creationDate":"2022-02-16T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market group on the second leg of The FIDE Grand Prix 2022 - a series of three chess tournaments, to be played between 3 February and 4 April 2022 in Berlin, Germany and Belgrade, Serbia.\n\nThe top two finishers qualify for the Candidates Tournament 2022, which is the final qualification stage for the World Chess Championship 2023.","enableNegRisk":false,"featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fide-world-chess-grand-prix-2022-leg-2-218f3bcb-92b4-4b52-8bb4-54585871d5ab.png","id":"5807","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fide-world-chess-grand-prix-2022-leg-2-218f3bcb-92b4-4b52-8bb4-54585871d5ab.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:44:16.4+00","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://worldchess.com/series/grandprix2022","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"FIDE-World-Chess-Grand-Prix-2022-Leg-2","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-02-22T00:00:00Z","ticker":"FIDE-World-Chess-Grand-Prix-2022-Leg-2","title":"FIDE World Chess Grand Prix 2022 Leg #2","updatedAt":"2024-04-23T22:46:46.384953Z","volume":8294.38,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}],"featured":false,"fee":"10000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"1","groupItemTitle":"Alexander Grischuk wins Pool A?","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fide-world-chess-grand-prix-2022-leg-2-will-alexander-grischuk-win-pool-a-e98dc27b-61d3-4f42-8ef7-9d0dc216ac20.png","id":"241566","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fide-world-chess-grand-prix-2022-leg-2-will-alexander-grischuk-win-pool-a-e98dc27b-61d3-4f42-8ef7-9d0dc216ac20.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"300.000023","liquidityNum":300,"manualActivation":false,"marketGroup":165,"marketMakerAddress":"0xdB261B256496A317a99A4aa302cb36274694cf83","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.0000001046306574112695335065713886590277\", \"0.9999998953693425887304664934286113\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"FIDE World Chess Grand Prix 2022 Leg #2: Will Alexander Grischuk win Pool A?","questionID":"0x260e3e310d4019a22c033a577c509521bac567af17b5c00b85e57ba529240ca0","ready":false,"readyForCron":true,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://worldchess.com/series/grandprix2022","resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"fide-world-chess-grand-prix-2022-leg-2-will-alexander-grischuk-win-pool-a","spread":1,"startDate":"2022-02-22T15:44:11.091Z","startDateIso":"2022-02-22","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1646768527427","twitterCardLastValidated":"1645749556.0831478","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fide-world-chess-grand-prix-2022-leg-2-will-alexander-grischuk-win-pool-a.png?1646768527427","umaEndDate":"March 25, 2022","umaEndDateIso":"2022-03-25","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2024-04-24T23:26:17.77704Z","updatedBy":15,"volume":"1713.274565","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":1713.27,"wideFormat":false}
