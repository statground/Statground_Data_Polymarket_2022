Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA or to the USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by July 15, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n","enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2022-07-11T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-07-11","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"Pop-Culture ","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:43:45.907Z","commentCount":1791,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:43:45.907Z","creationDate":"2022-06-23T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"'Thor: Love and Thunder' is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Thor.
