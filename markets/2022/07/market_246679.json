The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt10954984/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (July 22-24) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if 'Nope' grosses more than $60,000,000 on the opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA or to the USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by July 28, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n\n","enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2022-07-25T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-07-25","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"Pop-Culture ","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:43:59.398Z","commentCount":1791,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:43:59.398Z","creationDate":"2022-07-11T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"'Nope' is an upcoming American science fiction horror film written, directed, and co-produced by Jordan Peele under his Monkeypaw Productions banner.
