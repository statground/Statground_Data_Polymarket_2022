The decisions on the target federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. \n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC’s statement after its meeting scheduled for January 31 through February 1, 2023 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. \n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if following the Federal Reserve's January/February 2023 meeting the upper bound of the target federal funds rate is exactly the same as the level it was prior to the meeting (namely it increased 0 bps). Otherwise, it will resolve to “No.” \n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm. \n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC’s statement for their January/February meeting with relevant data is issued.
