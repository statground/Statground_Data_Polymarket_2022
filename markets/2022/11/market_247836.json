Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the margin of victory is the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by each candidate in the election. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each candidate receives by the sum of all votes received by both candidates.\n\nFor example, if Candidate A receives 53% of the votes, and Candidate B receives 47% of the votes, the difference will be found by subtracting 47 from 53, thus the margin of victory in this case would equal 6 (|Candidate A% - Candidate B%| = Margin of Victory).\n\nDetermination of the margin of victory in the Georgia Senate runoff election will be based on official election results (e.g. https://sos.ga.gov/).\n","enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2022-12-06T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-12-06","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-12-21T11:01:01Z","commentCount":0,"commentsEnabled":false,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-11-18T16:54:47.454Z","creationDate":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"In the 2022 midterm election for United States Senator from Georgia, no candidate received a majority of votes.
