The 135th edition is scheduled to take place between June 27, and July 10, 2022.\n\nThis is a market on whether Rafael Nadal will play at least one point in the 2022 Wimbledon Championships Men's Singles Tournament. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Nadal plays at least one point. For example, if Nadal wins one point during a match in the 2022 Wimbledon Championships and the score is 15-0, or loses one point and the score is 0-15, then this will suffice to resolve the market to \"Yes.\". The market cannot resolve to \"Yes\" until Nadal has actually played a point. \n\nThis market will resolve to “No” if the first round of the 2022 Wimbledon Championships starts and Rafael Nadal is not listed as a participant in any matches. If Nadal is listed as a participant but does not play a single point, the market will also resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf the 2022 Wimbledon Championships have not started by July 11, 2022, (12:00 PM ET), this market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the organisers (presently found at https://www.wimbledon.com/), however credible media sources will also suffice.","enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2022-06-30T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-06-30","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"Sports","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:43:47.177Z","commentCount":0,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:43:47.177Z","creationDate":"2022-06-24T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"The Wimbledon Championships, commonly known simply as Wimbledon or The Championships, is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is widely regarded as the most prestigious.
