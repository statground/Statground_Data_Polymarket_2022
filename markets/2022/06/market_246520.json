If an accident or inclement weather (typically heavy rain) prevents normal racing from continuing safely, the Race Director calls for a \"safety car\" period, which sees marshals wave yellow flags and hold \"SC\" boards, pending the car in question entering the track. \n\nThis is a market on the number of safety car (SC) periods run at the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which is scheduled to take place over 51 laps of the 6.003-kilometre Baku City Circuit on Sunday, June 12.\n\nThe market will resolve to “Yes” if there are 2 or more safety car periods in the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nNote: \n- For the purposes of this market, only Safety Car periods (SC) are to be counted. A virtual safety car period will not count toward market resolution. If a virtual safety car period is upgraded to become a full safety car period, it may then be counted as 1 safety car period.\n- A red flag period will not count as a safety car period, but a safety car period running for 1 lap or more that becomes a red flag will count as 1 safety car period. \n- If the race begins under a safety car, usually done in case of rain causing a standing start to be deemed unsafe, this will count as a safety car, as long as 1 counted lap has taken place.\n- If for any reason the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix is rescheduled to a different time or date on or before June 19, 2022, the same market conditions will apply. If the race does not finish by June 19, and \"Yes\" conditions are not met, this market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the official F1 website: https://www.formula1.com/, particularly the race report and lap-by-lap links that will populate the website under https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2022/Azerbaijan.html","enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2022-06-12T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-06-12","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"Sports","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:42:10.006Z","commentCount":0,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:42:10.006Z","creationDate":"2022-06-10T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market group on the Formula 1 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a race scheduled to take place over 51 laps of the 6.003-kilometre Baku City Circuit on Sunday, June 12.","enableNegRisk":false,"featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/formula1.jpg","id":"5561","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/formula1.jpg","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:42:10.003+00","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"fromula-1-2022-azerbaijan-grand-prix","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-06-10T00:00:00Z","ticker":"fromula-1-2022-azerbaijan-grand-prix","title":"Formula 1: 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix","updatedAt":"2024-03-22T01:47:06.455382Z","volume":5257.21,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}],"featured":false,"fee":"5000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"2","groupItemTitle":"Will there be 2 or more safety cars?","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/formula1.jpg","id":"246520","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/formula1.jpg","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"150.05502","liquidityNum":150.06,"manualActivation":false,"marketGroup":485,"marketMakerAddress":"0x8feca587d2764421FB343F091DbbeB1B2e53694d","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.000001753381541396281893293373334548268\", \"0.9999982466184586037181067066266655\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Formula 1: Will there be 2 or more safety cars at the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix?","questionID":"0xcc4ff6ff7918371665cea284f1b341af0f80148383ec1d36def1d8445606c592","ready":false,"readyForCron":true,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2022/Azerbaijan.html","resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"secondsDelay":0,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"formula-1-will-there-be-2-or-more-safety-cars-at-the-2022-azerbaijan-grand-prix","spread":1,"startDate":"2022-06-10T15:02:19.315Z","submitted_by":"0x400567bc06000e36db66f725f16d08f4C579D1Fe","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1654959081344","twitterCardLastValidated":"1655043417.4435549","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/formula-1-will-there-be-2-or-more-safety-cars-at-the-2022-azerbaijan-grand-prix.png?1654959081343","umaEndDate":"July 12, 2022","umaEndDateIso":"2022-07-12","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T14:03:47.349Z","updatedBy":127,"volume":"1086.432246","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":1086.43,"wideFormat":false}
