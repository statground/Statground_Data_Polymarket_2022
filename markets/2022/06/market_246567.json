If Fabiano Caruana finishes it in a higher position than Hikaru Nakamura, this market will resolve to \"Caruana\". If Hikaru Nakamura finishes it in a higher position than Fabiano Caruana, this market will resolve to \"Nakamura\".\n\nIf it is clear at any point in the tournament that one of the players will finish higher than the other based on the format of the tournament, the market will resolve immediately. \n\n---\n\nIf there is a tie for first place, tie-breaks take the following format:\n\nPlayers play two rapid chess games at 15 minutes plus 10 seconds per move. In the case of a three-way to six-way tie, a single round-robin is played. If seven or eight players are tied, a single round-robin is played with a time limit of 10 minutes plus 5 seconds per move. \n\nIf any players are still tied for first after the rapid chess games, they play two blitz chess games at 3 minutes plus 2 seconds per move. In the case of more than two players tied, a single round-robin is played. If any players are still tied for first after those blitz chess games, the remaining players play a knock-out blitz tournament at the same time control. In each mini-match of the knock-out tournament, the first player to win a game wins the mini-match.  \n\nTies for places other than first are broken by, in order: (1) Sonneborn–Berger score; (2) total number of wins; (3) head-to-head score among tied players; (4) drawing of lots.","enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2022-07-05T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-07-05","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"Chess","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:43:41.865Z","commentCount":0,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:43:41.865Z","creationDate":"2022-06-18T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"The 2022 Candidates Tournament is an eight-player chess tournament, with the winner qualifying for the challenger's spot against the defending champion Magnus Carlsen in the World Chess Championship 2023.
