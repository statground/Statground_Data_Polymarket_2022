Specifically, a manual count will be done on the number of positive COVID-19 cases, where the date the case was reported (see “Date of positive case reported” column) is on or after July 23, 2021 (Opening Ceremony) and on or before August 8, 2021 (Closing Ceremony), and the person testing positive is an athlete (see the “Category” column, with cell values indicating “Athletes”). Note if the date of the Opening or Closing Ceremonies change, this market will still resolve on the number of positive cases among athletes between July 23, 2021 and August 8, 2021.
