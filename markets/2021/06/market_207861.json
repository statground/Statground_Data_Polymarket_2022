The match is currently set to consist of eight rounds. This market will resolve to “Yes” if the referee of the match stops and ends the fight at any time before the completion of the final round. This market will resolve to “No” otherwise. This market will resolve on completion of the match, which is scheduled to take place on June 6, 2021 at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

If, for any reason, this match is postponed and a new fight date is set for June 30, 2021, or earlier, the same rules for market resolution will apply for the rescheduled fight.
