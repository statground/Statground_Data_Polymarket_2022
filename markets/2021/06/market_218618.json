The \"fully diluted market cap\" is determined by multiplying the price of the token by the total supply of tokens. The lower bound for this market is $0, and the upper bound is $4,000,000,000. The date by which the token is actively traded refers to the first date the token reaches over $10,000 in volume according to CoinGecko. The fully diluted market cap 1 week after this date, at 12:00 PM ET, will be used for this market’s resolution. For example, if the dy/dx token began actively trading on a Tuesday (in ET), the fully diluted market cap of the token would be checked at 12:00 PM ET the following Tuesday in order to resolve this market.

Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.
