The lower bound for this market is $18.00, and the upper bound is $32.00. The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chainlink). This market will resolve on the “C” (i.e. closing price) listed for the candle titled “Thu 15 July 2021, 12:00:00”, with the “Price” tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on July 15, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the “C:” when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If Coingecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith by the MIC to resolve the market.\n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $LINK's price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).","endDate":"2021-07-15T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2021-07-15","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"category":"Crypto","closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:40:53.081Z","commentCount":0,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:40:53.081Z","creationDate":"2021-06-10T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a scalar market on what the price of $LINK (Chainlink) will be on July 15, 12:00 PM ET.
