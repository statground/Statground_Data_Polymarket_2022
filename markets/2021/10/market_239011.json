The resolution source for this market will be the Global Climate Report for October 2021, published by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2021). This market will resolve to “Yes” if, for the month of October 2021 averaged as a whole, global land and ocean surface temperature anomaly, as measured by U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will be ranked the highest for October since global records began, and “No” otherwise. Note that if this October ties for highest, it will result in the market resolving to \"Yes.\" Past data for the month of October can be found here https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/1/10/1880-2021. This market will resolve when data first becomes available for the month of October 2021.\n\nNote: According to data at market's inception, the warmest October was in 2015, when the average global land and ocean temperature was 1.03°C (1.85°F) above the 20th century average of 14.0°C (57.1°F). However, that data might be modified, thus the market resolves to \"Yes\" only if NOAA lists October 2021 as the hottest or tied for the hottest since the records began.","featured":false,"fee":"20000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"","id":"239011","image":"","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"954.221442","liquidityNum":954.22,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"0xC429edA12ad850823C6a3B04F4B3e8ca6e700611","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.0000001604147159153276689923588111803063\", \"0.9999998395852840846723310076411888\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will October 2021 average global temperature be the highest October temperature on record?","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2021 ","resolvedBy":"0xCd2CD1B7Cb8feD9aaC8508ABa3333AAD81f1211f","restricted":false,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"will-october-2021-average-global-temperature-be-the-highest-october-temperature-on-record","spread":1,"submitted_by":"0x54e65dF2F0cd20ccF5D39C040dF3cD21E82F7D9A","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1637071240662","twitterCardLastValidated":"1637020365.0188117","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-october-2021-average-global-temperature-be-the-highest-october-temperature-on-record.png?1637071240662","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T18:12:02.489Z","updatedBy":15,"volume":"19226.373878","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":19226.37,"wideFormat":false}
