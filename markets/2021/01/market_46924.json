This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @DonaldJTrumpJr, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@DonaldJTrumpJr\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @DonaldJTrumpJr just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Donald Trump Jr., nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account.

In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available.
