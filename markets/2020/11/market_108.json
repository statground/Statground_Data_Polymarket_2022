The average sale price will be calculated using the average of the sales from 12:00 PM EST on December 25th, 2020 till 8 PM EST on December 25th, 2020.

All prices denominated in US Dollar.\n\nAs this is a Scalar market, you can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the Jordan 1 Mocha's average price on that day. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.
