The average sale price will be calculated using the average of the sales from 12:00 PM EST on December 25th, 2020 till 8 PM EST on December 25th, 2020. The average sale price will be computed by taking the simple average (Sum of sale prices divided by number of sales that took place within the time period) based on the sales occurring during the previously defined time window at the webpage listed above. All prices denominated in US Dollar.\n\nAs this is a Scalar market, you can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the PS5's average price on that day. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).","endDate":"2020-12-26T00:00:00Z","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2022-08-23T00:13:15.266Z","commentCount":0,"commentsEnabled":false,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2022-08-23T00:13:15.266Z","creationDate":"2020-12-04T00:00:00Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a scalar market on the average sale price (in USD) of the Sony PS5 PlayStation 5 (US Plug) Blu-Ray Edition Console 3005718 White on Christmas day, 2020.
