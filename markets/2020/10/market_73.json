If Trump says he “Won”, or claims definitive victory, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If he claims he won before the market resolution time, but later admits to losing or informally or formally concedes before November 5th, that will overrule his previous claim of winning, and the market will resolve to “No”.  If he claims something to the effect of that it looks like he is going to win, or he should win, or *should’ve* won, the market will resolve to “No”. The Tweet must be in the form of an announcement claiming victory, not a tweet about rejecting official results and that he should be the winer. If he rejects the results as being insufficient in some way or needing a recount, but does not definitively claim he Won, in the fashion of claiming victory, the market will resolve to “No”. If the election hasn’t been called yet by resolution time, and Trump has not definitively claimed victory, the market will resolve to “No”. If Trump wins and announces it via Tweet before resolution time, the market will resolve to “Yes”. It boils down to Trump tweeting definitively that he successfully won, not that the results are wrong and he should’ve won: it must resemble a victory tweet.
