Data will be checked at 8:00 PM ET, January 4, 2022, and every day subsequently if data is not available. \n\nIf data is not available for the week ending on January 1, 2022 by January 10, 2022, the market will resolve based on the most recent weekly data before January 1, 2022. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nPlease note, Nowcast does not predict future spread of the virus nor it provides exact current data, but it does help estimate current prevalence of variants, based on genomic surveillance data from previous weeks. Estimates of variant proportions for previous weeks may change as more data are reported. Nowcast estimates consistently align with the weighted proportions based on reported sequencing data, which are published 2-3 weeks later.\n\nTo identify and track SARS-CoV-2 variants, CDC uses genomic surveillance. \n\nThe CDC provides weekly Nowcast estimates which are updated every week on Tuesday.","endDate":"2022-01-04T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-01-04","featured":false,"fee":"20000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"85","groupItemTitle":"85% or more","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-at-least-85-of-us-covid-19-cases-be-from-the-omicron-variant-on-january-1-2022-aed013d8-e5e2-4c80-aaab-bf27064c1cba.png","id":"240234","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-at-least-85-of-us-covid-19-cases-be-from-the-omicron-variant-on-january-1-2022-aed013d8-e5e2-4c80-aaab-bf27064c1cba.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"99.969252","liquidityNum":99.97,"mailchimpTag":"3930091","manualActivation":false,"marketGroup":6,"marketMakerAddress":"0x45478CCF14ebae8fFd7f28001ad034959a7E3c69","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.9999998932798963334012975053450978\", \"0.0000001067201036665987024946549022282186\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will at least 85% of U.S. COVID-19 cases be from the Omicron variant on January 1, 2022?","ready":false,"readyForCron":true,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions","resolvedBy":"0x0dD333859cF16942dd333D7570D839b8946Ac221","restricted":false,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"will-at-least-85-of-us-covid-19-cases-be-from-the-omicron-variant-on-january-1-2022","spread":1,"startDate":"2021-12-28T21:55:35.929Z","startDateIso":"2021-12-28","submitted_by":"0x4b24b1b119fd23aD723A2C2286047CC453DF4AA1","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1641430880558","twitterCardLastValidated":"1640953176.7658174","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-at-least-85-of-us-covid-19-cases-be-from-the-omicron-variant-on-january-1-2022.png?1641430880558","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2024-04-22T22:44:47.588047Z","updatedBy":15,"volume":"18123.190492","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":18123.19,"wideFormat":false}],"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:41:45.814+00","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions","restricted":false,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"what-percent-of-us-covid19-cases-will-be-from-the-omicron-variant-on-january-1-2022","sortBy":"descending","startDate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","tags":[{"forceShow":false,"id":"100215","label":"All","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"all","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z"}],"ticker":"what-percent-of-us-covid19-cases-will-be-from-the-omicron-variant-on-january-1-2022","title":"What percent of US COVID-19 cases will be from the Omicron variant on January 1, 2022?","updatedAt":"2024-04-25T19:26:46.882929Z","volume":641474.95,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}
