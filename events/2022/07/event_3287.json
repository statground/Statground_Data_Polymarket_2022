For this market, “KOs, TKOs, or retires Logan Paul” will be considered any of the following: (1) a true knockout, where Mayweather delivers a legal blow or series of legal blows, such that Paul falls to the canvas and cannot make the count, causing the fight to be stopped early, (2) a technical knockout, where Mayweather delivers a legal blow or series of legal blows such that the referee intervenes to stop the fight early to protect Paul’s safety, (3) failing to answer to the bell, where Mayweather delivers a legal blow or series of legal blows throughout the match, such that Paul does not rise for the opening bell for a round, due to, for example, doctor stoppage, retirement from the match, (\"throwing in the towel”).
