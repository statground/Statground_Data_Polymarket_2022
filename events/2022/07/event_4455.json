Congress has defined those statutory emergency powers, available to the President upon the declaration of an emergency (so called \"National Emergency\"). Congress also can terminate an emergency declaration with a joint resolution enacted into law.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if, within this market's timeframe, President Joe Biden declares a new National Emergency. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\". \n\nThis market's timeframe spans from July 21 to August 31 (inclusive).\n\nPlease note for this market to resolve to \"Yes\" the national emergency declaration must be official, issued under authority of the National Emergencies Act by the Executive Office of the President, with a publication date within this market's timeframe. Any public announcement by President Biden without an official declaration will not suffice to resolve this market to \"Yes\". \n\nA continuation of any existing National Emergencies will not suffice to resolve this market to \"Yes\". An executive emergency order which is not subject to the provisions of the National Emergencies Act will not suffice to resolve this market to \"Yes\".  \n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the Federal Register of official documents published by the Executive Office of the President (https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/executive-office-of-the-president), however other official government sources may be used.","enableNegRisk":false,"endDate":"2022-08-31T00:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/National+emergency.png","id":"4455","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/National+emergency.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:41:03.306+00","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"(https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/executive-office-of-the-president","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"will-president-biden-declare-a-national-emergency-before-september","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-07-26T00:00:00Z","tags":[{"forceShow":false,"id":"100215","label":"All","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"all","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z"}],"ticker":"will-president-biden-declare-a-national-emergency-before-september","title":"(Early Resolved) Will President Biden declare a new National Emergency before September?","updatedAt":"2024-03-22T01:57:13.897025Z","volume":4461.17,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}
