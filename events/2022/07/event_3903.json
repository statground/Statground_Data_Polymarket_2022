The \"fully diluted market cap\" is determined by multiplying the price of the token by the total supply of tokens. The lower bound for this market is $250,000,000 and the upper bound is $3,000,000,000. The date by which the token is actively traded refers to the first date the token reaches over $10,000 in volume according to CoinGecko. The fully diluted market cap 1 week after this date, at 12:00 PM ET, will be used for this market’s resolution. For example, if the SuperRare token began actively trading on a Tuesday (in ET), the fully diluted market cap of the token would be checked at 12:00 PM ET the following Tuesday in order to resolve this market. If the total supply is infinite, the circulating supply/non-diluted market cap will be used instead to resolve this market. If the CoinGecko website is unavailable at the time of this check, or relevant data is unavailable on CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap will be used instead. If both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap are down, or relevant data is unavailable, then another credible source will be chosen.\n\nIf SuperRare does not release a token by December 31, 2021, 11:59:59 PM ET, the market will resolve to $1,625,000,000, which is in between the lower and upper bounds of the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with SuperRare token’s fully diluted market cap value in USD. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.
