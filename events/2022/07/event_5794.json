As a result, On 7 July 2022, Boris Johnson, the Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party since 2019, announced his resignation as party leader, but plans to remain as prime minister until a successor is chosen.\n\nThe 2022 Conservative Party leadership election to determine Boris Johnson's successor as Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party is due to start on July 13, 2022, with final results expected on September 5, 2022.\n\n---\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Kemi Badenoch wins the election to become the Conservative Party leader succeeding Boris Johnson. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution of this market will be based on the first official announcement of the next permanent Conservative Party leader after Boris Johnson, as chosen by a Conservative Party leadership contest. The primary resolution source will be official government sources reporting the result of the election; however, a consensus of credible media sources will also suffice.\n\nIf the successor to Boris Johnson is not known by December 31, 2022, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThis market may only resolve to \"No\" once Kemi Badenoch announces she is no longer in contention for head of the Conservative Party, or the Conservative party announces Kemi Badenoch is no longer in contention for head of the Conservative Party, or election results eliminate Kemi Badenoch from the running for leader of the Conservative Party, or the next leader of the Conservative Party after Boris Johnson is officially selected and it is not Kemi Badenoch.\n\nPlease note that acting leaderships do not count toward the resolution of this market.","enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-12-31","featured":false,"fee":"5000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"5","groupItemTitle":"Kemi Badenoch","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/KemiBadenoch.jpg","id":"246703","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/KemiBadenoch.jpg","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"31.453301","liquidityNum":31.45,"manualActivation":false,"marketGroup":497,"marketMakerAddress":"0x6A52F108a571D315933871D26d4E2d72DD506a1E","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.000002029175483930436752510276483314883\", \"0.9999979708245160695632474897235167\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Kemi Badenoch be the next UK Conservative Party Leader?","questionID":"0x1bc6d87da2224bd9ef9a33086bac69392f4f0394ae8a311c620d435df1801ebe","ready":false,"readyForCron":true,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"secondsDelay":0,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"will-kemi-badenoch-be-the-next-uk-conservative-party-leader","spread":1,"startDate":"2022-07-13T14:04:27.938Z","submitted_by":"0x400567bc06000e36db66f725f16d08f4C579D1Fe","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1658257216402","twitterCardLastValidated":"1658244197.6667347","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-kemi-badenoch-be-the-next-uk-conservative-party-leader.png?1658257216402","umaEndDate":"March 1, 2023","umaEndDateIso":"2023-03-01","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T17:46:56.686Z","updatedBy":126,"volume":"851.348569","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":851.35,"wideFormat":false}],"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:44:09.082+00","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"who-will-replace-boris-johnson","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-07-12T00:00:00Z","tags":[{"forceShow":false,"id":"100215","label":"All","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"all","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z"}],"ticker":"who-will-replace-boris-johnson","title":"Who will replace Boris Johnson?","updatedAt":"2024-03-22T02:00:26.66375Z","updatedBy":"15","volume":226670.01,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}
