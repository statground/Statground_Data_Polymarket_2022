The market will resolve to “Yes” if any US state reports record high 7-day average COVID-19 cases on or after the date of this market’s market inception, July 19, 2021, and on or before December 31, 2021. Otherwise, the market will resolve to “No.” For example, if a US state had a previous record high 7-day average of 10,000 COVID-19 cases, and reached 10,000 or more 7-day average COVID-19 cases again before January 1, 2022, this market would resolve to “Yes.” This market will resolve on data from the CDC's Data Tracker, specifically, the 7-day moving average of COVID-19 cases for each of the 50 states, which is available at https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases (navigate to \"Select a state or territory\" and select a given state of interest, and then scroll to \"Data Table for Daily Case Trends\" and view the data in the \"7-Day Moving Avg\" column, which is able to be sorted in descending order). Note that this market only refers to US states, not territories. The resolution source will be reviewed once daily at 8 PM ET, to see if any US states reported record high 7-day average COVID-19 cases. The market will resolve immediately if the criteria for “Yes” are met. The final check will be on January 8, 2022, 8 PM ET, checking all days from the creation of this market to December 31, 2021. If the website is down or data is unavailable during the final check, the market will resolve based on the most recent previous check that had data available. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n\n-Note that New York (excluding NYC) and New York City both appear in the dropdown.
