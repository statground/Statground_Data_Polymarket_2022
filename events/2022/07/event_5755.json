The 4-day opening weekend for this market is defined as the long weekend of Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday (U.S. Memorial Day) after the film's release - May 27 to May 30. The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2500036097/ will resolve this market once the values for the 4-day weekend (May 27-30) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if 'Top Gun: Maverick' grossed $130,000,000 or more on the 4-day opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf there is no final data available by June 6, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible source will be chosen and looked at.","enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2022-05-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-05-31","featured":false,"fee":"10000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"1","groupItemTitle":"$130 million or more gross on 4-day Memorial Weekend?","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/Maverick.jpg","id":"245078","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/Maverick.jpg","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"100.060034","liquidityNum":100.06,"manualActivation":false,"marketGroup":444,"marketMakerAddress":"0xb8D7457d5643d4FBa4D92C7a9Bee52E195bb1e71","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.9999997337541518048821220467695412\", \"0.0000002662458481951178779532304588379155\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ gross $130 million or more on the 4-day Memorial Weekend domestically?","questionID":"0xdf93c9c23b3cf90ed1d17f1a181d0f5ef688ba9b6d32150322ce174ce972c9af","ready":false,"readyForCron":true,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2500036097/ ","resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"secondsDelay":0,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"will-top-gun-maverick-gross-130-million-or-more-on-the-4-day-memorial-weekend-in-the-usa","spread":1,"startDate":"2022-05-19T20:52:23.97Z","submitted_by":"0x400567bc06000e36db66f725f16d08f4C579D1Fe","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1653593546132","twitterCardLastValidated":"1654043482.9769607","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-top-gun-maverick-gross-130-million-or-more-on-the-4-day-memorial-weekend-in-the-usa.png?1653593546132","umaEndDate":"June 8, 2022","umaEndDateIso":"2022-06-08","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T16:54:58.752Z","updatedBy":15,"volume":"24354.594695","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":24354.59,"wideFormat":false}],"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-27 14:43:49.469+00","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":4010,"commentsEnabled":false,"competitive":"0","createdAt":"2023-06-12T16:25:03.836Z","createdBy":"15","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/box+office+open.png","id":"46","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/box+office+open.png","layout":"default","liquidity":5310.6266,"new":false,"publishedAt":"2023-06-12 16:25:11.607+00","recurrence":"weekly","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"seriesType":"single","slug":"box-office-openings","startDate":"2023-06-07T16:00:00Z","ticker":"box-office-openings","title":"Box Office Openings","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T13:05:10.107101Z","updatedBy":"9","volume":5500.58235,"volume24hr":0}],"seriesSlug":"box-office-openings","showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"topgunmaverick","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-05-10T00:00:00Z","tags":[{"forceShow":false,"id":"100215","label":"All","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"all","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z"}],"ticker":"topgunmaverick","title":"'Top Gun: Maverick' - Rotten Tomatoes & Box Office","updatedAt":"2024-03-22T01:54:53.953191Z","volume":79726.61,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}
