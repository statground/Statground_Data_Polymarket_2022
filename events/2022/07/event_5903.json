It is scheduled to be released in the United States on August 5, 2022, by Columbia Pictures.\n\nThis is a market on how much 'Bullet Train' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt12593682/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (August 5-7) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if 'Bullet Train' grosses more than $32,500,000 on the opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA or to the USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by August 12, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.","enableNegRisk":false,"endDate":"2022-08-08T00:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bullet+train+2022.png","id":"5903","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bullet+train+2022.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-07-29 22:15:05.62+00","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt12593682/","restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":4010,"commentsEnabled":false,"competitive":"0","createdAt":"2023-06-12T16:25:03.836Z","createdBy":"15","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/box+office+open.png","id":"46","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/box+office+open.png","layout":"default","liquidity":5310.6266,"new":false,"publishedAt":"2023-06-12 16:25:11.607+00","recurrence":"weekly","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"seriesType":"single","slug":"box-office-openings","startDate":"2023-06-07T16:00:00Z","ticker":"box-office-openings","title":"Box Office Openings","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T13:05:10.107101Z","updatedBy":"9","volume":5500.58235,"volume24hr":0}],"seriesSlug":"box-office-openings","showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"will-bullet-train-gross-more-than-32pt5-million-domestically-on-its-opening-weekend","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-07-30T00:00:00Z","tags":[{"forceShow":false,"id":"100215","label":"All","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"all","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z"}],"ticker":"will-bullet-train-gross-more-than-32pt5-million-domestically-on-its-opening-weekend","title":"Will 'Bullet Train' gross more than $32.5 million domestically on its opening weekend?","updatedAt":"2024-03-22T01:47:36.137432Z","volume":27569.18,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}
