This market will resolve to “Yes” if Donald Trump launches a social media platform by the resolution date, and “No” otherwise. On the resolution date, it must be possible for an individual in the United States to create an account and post. Creating an account and posting requires that user-generated content is not restricted to responses (ie comments) to another user’s content. Such content generally must be standalone image, text, or video posts. The platform must not be restricted to only a small portion of the general public or subject to a waitlist. If there is a fee or subscription required to join, this market will still resolve to “Yes”. Donald Trump’s involvement must be public and verified via an official channel, and the platform must be substantially backed by or affiliated with Donald Trump--e.g. the platform uses his name explicitly, is heavily marketed as being affiliated with him, or he is an executive for the platform. Partnership with an existing platform such as Twitter or Parler will not be sufficient for this market to resolve to “Yes”. If such a platform is temporarily inaccessible due to maintenance, system overload, or DDOS attack, resolution of this market will be delayed up to 72 hours. If the platform is inaccessible on the resolution date due to a lack of a web-hosting service provider, this market will resolve to “No”. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n","enableNegRisk":false,"endDate":"2021-06-15T00:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-donald-trump-launch-a-new-social-media-platform-by-june-15-2021-f78761e0-668d-4395-9c82-341ef02924a8.png","id":"5508","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-donald-trump-launch-a-new-social-media-platform-by-june-15-2021-f78761e0-668d-4395-9c82-341ef02924a8.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"markets":[{"active":true,"approved":true,"archived":false,"bestAsk":1,"bestBid":0,"category":"US-current-affairs","clearBookOnStart":true,"clobTokenIds":"[\"42095503875423154037009171272474563086045798510427101759808125381598984362256\", \"27846509475373919509227011716277931674408815924684073847524873563135734381455\"]","closed":true,"closedTime":"2021-06-15 16:52:04+00","competitive":0,"conditionId":"0xaf01b2c889165b8963df1bbd61a54670915cd2376e79df473730f5154a5bcad4","createdAt":"2021-03-25T17:45:01.424Z","creator":"","cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market on whether former US President Donald Trump will launch a social media platform by June 15, 2021, 12:00 PM ET.
