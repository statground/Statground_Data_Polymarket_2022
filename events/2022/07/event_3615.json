This market will resolve to “Yes” if Austin McBroom KOs, TKOs, or retires Bryce Hall during their exhibition boxing match. For this market, “KOs, TKOs, or retires Bryce Hall” will be considered any of the following: (1) a true knockout, where McBroom delivers a legal blow or series of legal blows, such that Hall falls to the canvas and cannot make the count, causing the fight to stopped early, (2) a technical knockout, where McBroom delivers a legal blow or series of legal blows such that the referee intervenes to stop the fight early to protect Hall’s safety, (3) failing to answer to the bell, where McBroom delivers a legal blow or series of legal blows throughout the match, such that Hall does not rise for the opening bell for a round, due to, for example, doctor stoppage, retirement from the match, “throwing in the towel”.
