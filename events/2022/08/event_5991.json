In the event a Senate seat is vacant at 12:00 AM ET on the day of the 2022 US general election, and not subject to election on that date, that seat shall not be considered toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThe controlling party of the Senate is defined as the party to which a majority of Senators belong to, or if the Senate is split 50-50 between two parties, the party with which the vice president is affiliated with between those two parties. The controlling party of the House is defined as the party to which a majority of House members belong to.\n\nElected members of the House of Representatives who are without full voting rights (e.g. \"delegates”, “resident commissioners”) do not count toward the 435 members considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market will resolve after the results of the 2022 general elections, based on a consensus of credible reporting. If there is ambiguity, final state election authority certifications or other final official determinations of the 2022 election results may be used.","disqusThread":"midterms-2022","enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2022-11-08","featured":false,"fee":"6000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":"Democratic House and Republican Senate","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/congress+divided.png","id":"246979","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/congress+divided.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"176.42396","liquidityNum":176.42,"manualActivation":false,"marketGroup":506,"marketMakerAddress":"0x89869b86699Bb95d160F44f289095559C38E240D","marketType":"normal","negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.00000131631884384426074745549876592421\", \"0.9999986836811561557392525445012341\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Democratic House and Republican Senate after U.S. 2022 Midterms?","questionID":"0xf46f2b82011bfadd6eef6eda9896fbddc3201815a2f331f19f17a93747652191","ready":false,"readyForCron":true,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"secondsDelay":0,"sentDiscord":false,"slug":"democratic-house-and-republican-senate-after-us-2022-midterms","spread":1,"startDate":"2022-08-12T17:10:59.778Z","submitted_by":"0x281777D3bdD096d302791F94A2E429bb98474227","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1661169276770","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/democratic-house-and-republican-senate-after-us-2022-midterms.png?1661169276770","umaEndDate":"April 1, 2023","umaEndDateIso":"2023-04-01","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T20:25:17.209Z","updatedBy":9,"volume":"21055.179185","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volumeNum":21055.18,"wideFormat":false}],"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2022-08-12 17:13:23.291+00","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"balance-of-power-2022-us-midterms","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2022-08-12T00:00:00Z","tags":[{"forceShow":false,"id":"100215","label":"All","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"all","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z"}],"ticker":"balance-of-power-2022-us-midterms","title":"Balance of Power: 2022 US Midterms","updatedAt":"2024-03-22T01:57:13.897025Z","updatedBy":"9","volume":523515.55,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}
